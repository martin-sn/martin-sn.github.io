The goal of this project was to predit the realized volatility for the next 30 minutes using high frequency data for a large set of stocks. The project was complicated as the stock names and their timestaps had been obscurated. I did not have much time to put in to this project, but i managed to come up with an approriate cross validation setup and by using a gradient boosting algorithm i was able to get a reasonable result.
